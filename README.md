# HTTP Manager

This is a personal project I developed to remotely turn off my Windows computer via HTTP and perform some other tasks that i add from time to time. It's not intended to be used as a product or to be exposed to the public internet, as it doesn't use HTTPS and is only meant to be used in a private network. Please note that this project does not include any access control or authentication mechanisms and should be used at your own risk.
